      'I’ve always been a proponent of Javascript as a front end and back end language, especially when it comes to web based projects. In addition, the work required to get a new project up and running is minimal compared to other languages so it makes sense in the fast paced world of startups. A strictly typed language like Java would be good for companies willing to spend more time on development, but in a startup, speed is arguably most important. In my experience managing younger teams, it is much easier to have a single language that we can use on both the front end and the back end.',

      'Typescript has all the good parts about Javascript and also fixes some of the issues many have with the language. Typing does take a little more development time, but the end result is worth it due to several factors. Diagnosing errors before they happen becomes much easier, and the likelihood of mistakes from accessing unexpected variable types decrease as well. I’ve often taken the approach of prototyping with javascript, just to get something up and running, and then transitioning to typescript slowly once the proof of concept exists and the product requirements are more defined.
