      'In mid 2019, I co-founded Roof Rally, an online marketplace for roofing needs for homeowners. My team and I built a web application that allowed homeowners to easily gather prices and quotes for their roofing projects to local roofing contractors. Roof Rally launched in March of 2020 and over the next few months, we had some initial success with contractors subscribeing to our platform. Unfortunately, with the on-going Covid-19 pandemic of 2020, Roof Rally struggled to get enough homeowners on the platform for the contractors to continue to subscribe. Eventually, we had to make the tough decision to cease operations and close down the business.',

      'As my first job out of college, I worked as a Technology Risk consultant for EY for about 2 years. This position involved working closely with senior management in the risk functions of several Fortune 500 companies. One project I worked on involved developing the IT Risk program from scratch for a recently spun off life insurance company. We worked with different business functions to ensure that they had the proper IT controls in place to adequately address their risk. If they didn’t have the appropriate controls we would propose new controls to be implemented.',

Since it was such a small company, I was also heavily involved with the development process and the putting together financial models for some of the projects we were interested in pursuing. I also developed an internal tool we used to optimize the inverter sizing based on the target AC/DC ratio.',

While at Thermoking I wrote the procedure for the tear down off field test units and I helped develop several process efficiency tweaks involving fin array used for expelling heat. I also volunteered to transport a set of parts down to the manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico during an emergency shortage. Due to market conditions, all of the units Thermoking was producing were backordered, so we needed to ensure production didn’t stop because of a lost part. This protected around $800,000 in revenue for the company.',
