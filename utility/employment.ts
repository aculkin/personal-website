      "After Roof Rally was shut down in late 2020, Todd and I decided to pivot to a different idea. With Todd's extensive experience with Solar, we decided to pivot to the Renewable Energy data market. We decided to start an online platform that gathered and organized publicly available information about the solar industry. There are already a few companies that are in this market, but their products are extremely expensive, out of reach for most mid-tier solar/renewable energy development companies. We prioritized making our product easy to use, modern and at a significantly lower price than our competition.",

      'In mid 2019, I co-founded Roof Rally, an online marketplace for roofing needs for homeowners. I co-founded this company with my business partner Todd who’s had many years of experience in the solar industry and by extension the roofing industry. My team and I built a web application that allowed homeowners to essentially “crowd-source” getting prices for their roofing projects to trusted local roofing contractors. We launched in March of 2020 and over the next few months, we had contractors subscribe to our platform, and customers come to get bids. Eventually though, we made the tough decision to cease operations because we weren’t getting enough traction to be successful in the long run. While one could attribute some of Roof Rally’s struggles to the global COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, I don’t like to cite that as the only reason we did not succeed. There were some things we could have done differently, but I learned a lot of valuable lessons about leading a team, managing a business and starting a company.',

      'I worked as a Technology Risk consultant for EY for about 2 years. This position involved working closely with senior management in the risk functions of several Fortune 500 companies. One project I worked on involved developing the IT Risk program from scratch for a recently spun off life insurance company. We worked with different business functions to ensure that they had the proper IT controls in place to adequately address their risk. If they didn’t have the appropriate controls we would propose new controls to be implemented.',

      'I worked at ECA Solar, a small solar development company, for about 6 months prior to moving to NYC to work for EY. During my time at ECA Solar, I engineered several large scale rooftop solar systems that are currently operational. Since it was such a small company, I was also heavily involved with the development process and the putting together financial models for some of the projects we were interested in pursuing. I also developed an internal tool we used to optimize the inverter sizing based on the target AC/DC ratio.',

We developed a system for assessing the risk of using specific third parties including the information they received, and the impact they have on the business. This program was used to determine the frequency with which third parties needed to be re-assessed for their internal controls.',

While at Thermoking I wrote the procedure for the tear down off field test units and I helped develop several process efficiency tweaks involving fin array used for expelling heat. I also volunteered to transport a set of parts down to the manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico during an emergency shortage. Due to market conditions, all of the units Thermoking was producing were backordered, so we needed to ensure production didn’t stop because of a lost part. This protected around $800,000 in revenue for the company.',
